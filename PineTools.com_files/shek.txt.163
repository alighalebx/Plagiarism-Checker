and in my tongue,
Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,
Lest I (too much profane) should do it wronk:
And haply of our old acquaintance tell.  
For thee, against my self I'll vow debate,
For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate.



Then hate me when thou wilt, if ever, now,
Now while the world is bent my deeds to cross,
