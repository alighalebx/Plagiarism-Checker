lf-loving were iniquity.
'Tis thee (my self) that for my self I praise,
Painting my age with beauty of thy days.

Against my love shall be as I am now
With Time's injurious hand crushed and o'erworn,
When hours have drained his blood and filled his brow
With lines and wrinkles, when his youthful morn
Hath travelled on to age's steep
