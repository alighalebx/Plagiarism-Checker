But for their virtue only is their show,
They live unwooed, and unrespected fade,
Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so,
Of their sweet deaths, are sweetest odours made:  
And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,
When that shall vade, by verse distills your truth.

Not marble, nor the gilded monuments
Of princes shall outlive
