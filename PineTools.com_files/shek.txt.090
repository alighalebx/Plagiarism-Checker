ensconce me here
Within the knowledge of mine own desert,
And this my hand, against my self uprear,
To guard the lawful reasons on thy part,  
To leave poor me, thou hast the strength of laws,
Since why to love, I can allege no cause.

How heavy do I journey on the way,
When what I seek (my weary travel's end)
Doth teach that case
