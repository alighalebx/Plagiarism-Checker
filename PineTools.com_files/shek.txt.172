ners of their faces,
Others, but stewards of their excellence:
The summer's flower is to the summer sweet,
Though to it self, it only live and die,
But if that flower with base infection meet,
The basest weed outbraves his dignity:  
For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds,
Lilies that fester, smell far worse than weeds.
