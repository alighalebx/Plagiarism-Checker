 change,
In many's looks, the false heart's history
Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange.  
But heaven in thy creation did decree,
That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell,
Whate'er thy thoughts, or thy heart's workings be,
Thy looks should nothing thence, but sweetness tell.
How like Eve's apple doth thy beauty grow
