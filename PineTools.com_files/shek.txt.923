heart
Of bird, of flower, or shape which it doth latch,
Of his quick objects hath the mind no part,  
Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch:
For if it see the rud'st or gentlest sight,
The most sweet favour or deformed'st creature,
The mountain, or the sea, the day, or night:
The crow, or dove, it shapes them to your feature.
