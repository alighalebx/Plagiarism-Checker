If my slight muse do please these curious days,
The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.

O how thy worth with manners may I sing,
When thou art all the better part of me?
What can mine own praise to mine own self bring:
And what is't but mine own when I praise thee?
Even for this, let us divided live,
And our dear love
