our worth to sing:
For we which now behold these present days,
Have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.



Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul,
Of the wide world, dreaming on things to come,
Can yet the lease of my true love control,  
Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom.
The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured,
