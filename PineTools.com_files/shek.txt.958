 eyes become thy face:
O let it then as well beseem thy heart
To mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace,
And suit thy pity like in every part.
Then will I swear beauty herself is black,
And all they foul that thy complexion lack.



Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
For that deep wound it gives my friend and me;
